# plan

target on particular authors at first. and scrape data related to them using BeautifulSoup and requests

```py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

request library is used to make `get` requests to a particular web page

and the bs4 library is used to `parse` the html content that we get.

have to work a plan on how to be compatible with various different websites, but if we focus on a few particular websites, we can make shit work alteast for now.
